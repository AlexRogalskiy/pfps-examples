Standalone examples shown in the book [Practical FP in Scala: A hands-on approach](https://leanpub.com/pfp-scala).

⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTICE** If you come here from [Practical FP in Scala](https://leanpub.com/pfp-scala), go to the [master](https://github.com/gvolpe/pfps-examples/tree/master) branch. You're now on the `second-edition` branch, which is the new default, as I'm currently working on the 2nd edition of the book. ⚠️
